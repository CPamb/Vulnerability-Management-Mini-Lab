## Introduction
This mini lab is designed to provide hands-on experience in vulnerability management using Microsoft Azure and OpenVAS. The lab involves creating a vulnerable Windows 10 virtual machine, setting up a vulnerability scanner, performing unauthenticated and credentialed scans, and remediating identified vulnerabilities. The goal is to simulate real-world scenarios and gain skills in identifying and addressing security weaknesses.

## Prerequisites
Before starting the lab, ensure you have the following:

- Computer with Internet access
- Azure Account (Free subscription is possible)
  - Create an Azure Account: [Sign up](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/)
  - Login to Azure Portal: [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com)

## Steps

### 1. Prepare Vulnerability Management Scanner
- Navigate to Azure Portal: [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com)
- Go to the Marketplace and search for "OpenVAS secured and supported by HOSSTED."
- Start with a pre-set configuration, pick the weakest one, and continue to create a VM.
- Provide details such as Resource Group, VM Name, and Authentication.
- SSH into the VM and wait until the deployment is complete.
- Access the web app URL, log in with provided credentials, and reset the admin password to "Cyberlab123!"

### 2. Create Client Virtual Machine and Make it Vulnerable
- Search for Virtual Machines in the Azure Portal and create a new Virtual Machine.
- Configure details such as Resource Group, VM Name, Image, Size, and Networking.
- Disable Windows Firewall on the VM and install old versions of Firefox, VLC Player, and Adobe Reader.
- Restart the VM and leave it for further scanning.

### 3. Configure and Perform Unauthenticated Scan
- Log in to OpenVAS, add the Client VM's PRIVATE IP Address as a new host.
- Create a new target named "Azure Vulnerable VMs."
- Create a new task named "Scan - Azure Vulnerable VMs" and start the scan.
- Check the results after the scan is finished.

### 4. Configure Credentialed Scans
#### VM Configurations
- Within the vulnerable VM, disable Windows Firewall, User Account Control, and enable Remote Registry.
- Set a Registry Key as specified.
- Restart the VM.

#### OpenVAS Configurations
- In OpenVAS, create a new credential named "Azure VM Credentials."
- Clone the previous target and create a new one for credentialed scanning.
- Assign the newly created credentials to the SMB section.
- Save the configurations.

### 5. Execute Credentialed Scan
- In OpenVAS, clone the unauthenticated scan task and edit it for credentialed scanning.
- Launch the new scan and wait for it to finish.
- Examine the results and note the differences from the unauthenticated scan.

### 6. Remediate Vulnerabilities
- Log back into the Win10-Vulnerable VM.
- Uninstall Adobe Reader, VLC Player, and Firefox.
- Restart the VM.

### 7. Verify Remediations
- Re-initiate the credentialed scan in OpenVAS and observe the results.
- Confirm that vulnerabilities have been remediated.

## Conclusion
This mini lab provides a practical understanding of vulnerability management by simulating real-world scenarios. Participants gain hands-on experience in scanning, identifying vulnerabilities, and implementing remediation steps within a controlled environment.

## Potential Improvement
To enhance the lab experience, consider incorporating additional scenarios, such as more advanced vulnerabilities or different operating systems. Regularly update lab content to align with the latest security challenges and practices.
